# Karelia Developer Portal

## Project Goal

Our goal is to develop a visually modern and content-clear developer portal that especially serves the students, teachers, and partners of Karelia University of Applied Sciences.

The portal provides students with a platform to showcase their software projects, repositories, and outputs. It also serves as a valuable source of information for other students, teachers, and stakeholders who can benefit from these outputs and discover talent.

Throughout the project, we actively listened to the client’s wishes and feedback and developed the portal in an agile manner, step-by-step, in collaboration with all stakeholders.

The final result is expected to be technically up-to-date, visually attractive, and easy to use — a portal that enhances student visibility and collaboration within and beyond Karelia.
