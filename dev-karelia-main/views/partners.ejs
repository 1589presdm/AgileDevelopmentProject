            Work-life orientation is reflected in our teaching through various
            types of student projects. These projects provide employers with an
            excellent opportunity to engage our skilled and enthusiastic
            students. The outcomes of these projects deliver solutions and ideas
            for the specific practical problem you define, whether it involves
            marketing planning or product development.
